- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @J3ddda
The book is being written as im living it, and by living im contributing.
At first it was a mess, but little by little the untangled web of stories began to show themselves. Threads became reality with small breaths above the water of inspiration. Each day begins a new chapter and with each interaction a new character to explore appears.
Join us, the book is billiant and needs your help.
